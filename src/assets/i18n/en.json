From showing you super private advances to everything I learn through each challenge: technical, communication, team building, security, business structure, legality, emotional and motivational. I want to turn it into wisdom for you.

I can promise you two things: first, I will devote my life to making this vision a reality, and second, I will give full transparency to the MAGICKEY community into our endeavors, both our successes and our shortcomings. I got the unicorn mindset to build the next book thing. The next Youtube or Spotify of books that changes how people read and publish books forever.",

        "header": "Can I earn money with the MAGICKEYS?",
        "body": {
          "p1": "Yes, although it is important to understand the following. The price of the MAGICKEY is defined by the value of the service that you will receive in exchange. Its purpose is not speculative and that is why IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO LOSE MONEY and it has ABSOLUTELY ZERO RISK since you are immediately receiving the utility for which you are paying: access to the community of visionaries and a monthly video call with the founder. Same as buying an infoproduct but in an NFT version.",
          "p2": "With this clear, if over time the MAGICKEYS run out and the project continues to grow as we are going to make it happen, the demand will increase and the new owners will have to repurchase the MAGICKEY from one of the current holders. This means that you can resell your MAGICKEY for the price you are willing to buy it for. Furthermore, as DEBOOK grows over the years, the potential (not guaranteed) utility will begin to make sense and you will be able to access all the books by the authors who will publish on DEBOOK.",

          "p2": "If you choose to pay by credit card, you will have your MAGICKEY in your username within the Crossmint platform and you will be able to access it with a simple email.",

          "p1": "No. To access one of the three Unicorn editions you need to have 10 MAGICKEYS. If you access the first one, you will be able to come to all three if you are still the owner of 10MK.",
          "p2": "You will also have access to a unicorn WhatsApp group.",

          "p2": "Don't worry because from the Discord you have a very simple explanatory video to explain how.",
          "p3": "IMPORTANT: The purpose of the MAGICKEY is not speculation. It is impossible to lose money because for the price of access you are buying the community utility and the monthly video call. Because it is an NFT, you can resell it and it gives it the power to be resold if the demand is sufficient at the time you want to sell",
          "p4": "Everything that may come later, such as access to all published debooks, access to updates, pre-sales of best-selling authors, and all the surprises that we have in store,... will be the fruit of the success of DEBOOK and is not guaranteed. With this clear, you will surely receive the utility for which you are paying.",
